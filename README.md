# Cloud-Storage

1. The aim of this project is to implement a Server- Client model using Java and TCP/IP sockets where clients can upload files in a certain folder on their local file system on to the server. 
2. The Server is implemented on AWS. A windows instance is created in AWS, the server code is run in Eclipse on AWS instance. 
3. There are two clients one on the laptop and other on an Android device. On the execution of the client code, the files in specific folder in local machine would be uploaded on to the AWS Server.
